## This is the code book for the project

## Data 
# Data Source
The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. 
A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones Here are the data for the project: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
# Obtain the Data
Dataset downloaded and extracted under the folder called UCI HAR Dataset
## R code
codes in the R script "run_analysis.R" performs the preparation process and five following steps :
1. Preparation:
Downloading the data, extract the data and naming the colomn
2. Merge the training and test sets.
3. Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
4. Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
5. Appropriately labeling the data set with descriptive variable names
6. Creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
## Variables
1. The "features" selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ.
2. List of "activities" conducted when the measurements were taken and its labels
3. sub_test contains test data
4. x_test y_test correspond to recorded features test data and test data of activities’code labels
5. sub_train contains train data being obse recorded features train data observed.
6. x_train y_train correspond to recorded features train data and train data of activities’code labels
