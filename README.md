## Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
This is the Repo for Coursera's "Getting and Cleaning Data" project.The repo contains an R scrpit,a codebook, and a tidy data set(txt file) for the assignment.
## Files:
CodeBook.md describes the instructions of all the files, variables, the data, and some explanation towards how the work was done to clean up the data.
run_analysis.R contains all the code to conduct the process of getting and cleaning the data.Here are the five steps:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
After completeting all the steps one by one, the text file for the final clean data is gained : FinalData.txt
